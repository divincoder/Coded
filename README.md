As a student of Electronic and Communication Engineering, i discovered that must of my classmates and course mates find it hard understanding Digital Logic Theory and hence perform poorly in exams.
So i decided to write an Android application that will simplify this concepts and enhance understanding of the courses associated with digital logic theory.

FEATURES OF THE APP INCLUDES:
- Topic by topic explanation of concepts filled with examples and illustrations.
- Quiz to test learning and adequate understanding of the topics.
- Exam Prep questions with solutions.
- Video tutorials from renowned youtube channels, Universities and websites.
More features will be added based on feedbacks..
